# House Price Prediction using Python
This model is built from scratch using Python with ❤️ by Faisal Jan. It predicts the price of houses based on the house's size in *square feet*. This project taught me many machine learning and datascience concepts, such as Feature Engineering, Data cleaning, knowing the ML models(Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM), and the most important how machine actually learns and how these models are built on top of Linear Algebra and Calculus.
